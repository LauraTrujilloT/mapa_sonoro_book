```{admonition} Description
Time series analysis is one of the most common types of analysis done with SQL. A _time series_ is a sequence of measurements or data points recorded in time order, often at regularly spaced intervals. There are many examples of time series dta in daily life, such as the daily high temperature, the closing values of the S&P 500 stock index, or the number of daily steps recorded by your fitness tracker. Time series analysis is used in a wide variety of industries and disciplines, from statistics and engineering to weather forecasting and business planning. Time series analysis is a way to understand and quantify how things change over time.
